Each sheet has a character, with it's stats and background. The cards are printed in laminated card stock, making them dry-erasable for making notes and keep track of cantantly changing values, such as health points and spell slots. In the video below you can see what comes inside the box.<br><br>This project was developed togheter with my colleague, Camila Matsuda, for our undergraduate thesis, with orientation by Rodrigo Graça and Pamela Henriques. Camila designed the characters and I designed the layout of the cards.<br><br>In case you want to read more about this project, you can read our thesis (in portuguese) by <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1i09fSYLx_P1KDqOffVgz7CRuTpVOkMlw/view?usp=sharing">clicking here</a>.`);
