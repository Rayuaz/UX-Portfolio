On most other ecommerces, these filters are only checkboxes with labels. These types of menu not only look ugly, but also make it harder to find the specific category of product you were looking for, because they all look the same.<br><br>My solution was to create different buttons for each type of filter. Big buttons, extremely satisfying to click on.<br><br>Other than the buttons, the very category system of the products is much more robust to accomodate relevant categories for each product, and I also implemented a product tag system, to group them by theme, appearence, etc.<br><br>Despite the different look, "behind the curtains" all of these buttons are nothing more than checkboxes with buttons for labels, to make sure they are accessible.`);

This overlay is an HTML element, meaning I can make changes to it without having to redo all my 3D renders, and when the user clicks to see the image in full size, I can hide the overlay, so that there are no distractions from the image.<br><br>Implementing this feature was a challange in both PHP and javascript, but will save me quite of lot of time I would otherwise spend adding these overlays manually through photoshop.`);

On top of that, I also placed this section under the add to cart button.<br><br>This, in my opinion (still has to be tested), improves the reding rythim of the page, because the first thing the user will probably see is the product title, then price, and the add to cart button, which are the most basicm necessary information for him to make a decision.`);
