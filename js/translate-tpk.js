So I decided to study some HTML/CSS, and eventually PHP. After some days of studying, I began working a <a href='warlock.html'>little (at first) side project</a> to synthesize this new knowledge. When I came back to this project, I was ready to face this challing.<br><br>My biggest difficulties in this process were "fighting" with the default Woocommerce (Wordpress' ecommerce platform) javascript, performance optimizations, and accessibility, given that I was learning how to code while I developed the website.`);
